# Battle City Python game

This is a Google Code export of https://code.google.com/archive/p/battle-city-tanks

I DO NOT take any recognition for anything in this repository, I did not participate in developing it.

Considering that Google Code's future is uncertain, I wanted to save this repository because I thought it was a very good learning material on how to code games in Python.
